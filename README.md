# PowDroid: A lightweight tool for measuring the energy footprint of any Android application

Powdroid is a command-line tool that profiles the energy consumption of Android apps.
Simply test your application for a few minutes to generate a machine-ready output file containing various energy-related metrics.

## üîß Setup

Install the following dependencies:
- Android SDK platform tools (https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
- Python 3.10 or below (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pandas module
- GO runtime (https://go.dev/dl/)

‚ö†Ô∏è Then you must add command ```adb``` to your environment PATH (python and go should already be in the path, if not add them like adb):
- On Windows, edit the PATH environment variable in Advanced System Settings, then System Properties, then Environment Variables, and finally choose Path and edit it by adding the new path (the location where you installed platform-tools).
- On Unix-style systems: `export PATH=/the/path/to/target/:$PATH` to your .profile or .bashrc file.

## üöÄ Getting started

### Optimal test conditions

- Disable the Battery Saver Mode
- Disable screen timeout
- Set the brightness and sound level at 50%
- Kill running apps and background services
- A minimum 5-minute session (Battery level must decrease)

### Initial configuration

First, activate *USB Debugging* in your Android phone in *developer options*.
To verify and facilitate the use of "PowDroid" it is advised to do the first "Handshake" between your phone and the computer by connecting the phone through USB to the computer and type in a command prompt or shell the following: `adb devices`.
On your phone a prompt should appear asking for permission for debugging. If the computer is your personal computer and safe, you should check *Always allow from this computer*.

### Running and Using PowDroid

Just run `python powdroid.py -o csv` in your terminal and follow the on-screen instructions.

For more options, use the `--help` command.
